    p.kai What'd you want to be when you grew up?
    p.thomas Honestly, a musician
    p.kai What?
    p.thomas I know man crazy right
    p.kai Nah, what's crazy is original music hasn't been created since Earth
    p.thomas I know man. Lucidity
    p.kai What?
    p.thomas Back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious: water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I guess that's what I'm looking for

    p.kai We're not slaves Thomas
